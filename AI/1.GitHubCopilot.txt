what is "GitHub Copilot"? 

-An AI pair-programmer that suggests code, whole lines, and functions inside editors (VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains, Codespaces).
-Generates context-aware completions, examples, tests, and documentation using large language models trained on public code.
-Integrates via an extension and usually requires a subscription (free tiers/trials for some users).
-Not perfect—always review suggestions for correctness, security, and licensing.
