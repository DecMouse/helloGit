What is "Claude code"?

Claude is a family of AI language models from Anthropic. "Claude code" commonly refers to:
- Code generated by Claude (the model).
- Code written to call/integrate Claude's API (client code that sends prompts and receives completions).

Example (HTTP/cURL pseudocode — replace YOUR_API_KEY and endpoint per Anthropic docs):

curl -X POST "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/complete" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "model": "claude-1",
        "prompt": "Write a function that returns Fibonacci numbers.",
        "max_tokens": 300
    }'

Notes:
- Check Anthropic's official docs/SDK for current endpoints, parameters, and examples.
- If you mean "code generated by Claude", specify language and style for a concrete example.
